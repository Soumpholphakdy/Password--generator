# Password-generator

## Week 3 Challenge

This week's Challenge requires us to modify starter code to create an application to generate random passwords based on criteria that are selected. 

### User Story

Password generator will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I click the button to generate a password and I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

* It is done when prompted for at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

* It is done when I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

* It is done when my input is validated and at least one character type is selected.

* It is done when a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed.
